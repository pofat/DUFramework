[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pofat/DUFramework.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/pofat/DUFramework) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/pofat/DUFramework/branch/develop/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/pofat/DUFramework) ![pod version](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/DUFramework.svg) ![platform](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/p/DUFramework.svg?style=flat)

DUFramework is a framework that actually does nothing but looks cool on github. The source code is elegant, simple (just 4 lines) and easy to use.

For now we only support iOS platform. I will add more supported platforms if I get fired and have nothing to work on in the future.



## Getting started

-  Chedck out the [documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/DUFramework/) for a comprehensive look at all of the APIs available in DUFramework. (**Spoiled Alert** : Nothing is available here)



## Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C and Swift, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like DUFramework in your projects. Since this framework actually does nothing, I strongly recommend you not to install it. Otherwise you WILL LOSE STORAGE SPACE FOR SEVERAL MBs. Anyway, you can install it with the following command (if you insist) :

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 0.39.0+ is required to build AFNetworking 3.0.0+.

#### Podfile

To integrate AFNetworking into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'TargetName' do
  pod 'DUFramework'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
